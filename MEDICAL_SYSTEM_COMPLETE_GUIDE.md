This document describes the complete implementation of a medical X-ray classification system using MobileNetV3 architecture optimized for FPGA deployment. The system detects 15 different chest conditions with probability-based confidence scoring and clinical recommendations.

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Hardware Implementation
- **Model**: MobileNetV3 Small (optimized for FPGA)
- **Input**: 224x224 grayscale chest X-ray images
- **Output**: 15-class medical condition classification

### Processing Pipeline
```
Input Image (224x224) → First Layer → BNeck Blocks → Final Layer → Medical Analysis
```

## 📊 Medical Conditions Detected

The system classifies 15 chest X-ray conditions:

1. **No Finding** - Normal chest X-ray
2. **Infiltration** - Fluid or infection in lungs
3. **Atelectasis** - Partial lung collapse
4. **Effusion** - Fluid around lungs
5. **Nodule** - Small spot requiring further imaging
6. **Pneumothorax** - Air in lung cavity (EMERGENCY)
7. **Mass** - Abnormal tissue growth
8. **Consolidation** - Infection or pneumonia signs
9. **Pleural Thickening** - Scarring of lung lining
10. **Cardiomegaly** - Enlarged heart
11. **Emphysema** - Chronic lung disease
12. **Fibrosis** - Lung scarring
13. **Edema** - Fluid buildup in lungs

## 🔧 Key Implementation Files

### 1. Enhanced Testbench (`FULL_TOP/tb_full_system_top.sv`)
```systemverilog
// Medical condition class names
string medical_conditions [0:14] = {
    "No Finding", "Infiltration", "Atelectasis", "Effusion", "Nodule",
    "Pneumothorax", "Mass", "Consolidation", "Pleural Thickening", "Cardiomegaly",
    "Emphysema", "Fibrosis", "Edema", "Pneumonia", "Hernia"
};

// Medical recommendations for each condition
string medical_recommendations [0:14] = {
    "The X-ray appears normal. Continue regular health checkups.",
    "Possible fluid or infection in lungs. Consult a pulmonologist.",
    // ... (complete list of clinical recommendations)
};

// Probability conversion function
function real fixed_to_probability(input logic signed [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] fixed_val);
    real temp_real;
    temp_real = real'($signed(fixed_val)) / 256.0;
    
    // Apply sigmoid approximation
    if (temp_real > 5.0) temp_real = 1.0;
    else if (temp_real < -5.0) temp_real = 0.0;
    else temp_real = 1.0 / (1.0 + $exp(-temp_real));
    
    return temp_real;
endfunction
```

### 2. Medical Analysis Script (`analyze_disease_hex_outputs.py`)
```python
def fixed_to_probability(fixed_val, data_width=16, frac_bits=8):
    """Convert fixed-point value to probability (0.0 to 1.0)"""
    if fixed_val >= 2**(data_width-1):
        fixed_val -= 2**data_width
    
    temp_real = fixed_val / (2.0**frac_bits)
    
    # Apply sigmoid approximation
    if temp_real > 5.0: return 1.0
    elif temp_real < -5.0: return 0.0
    else: return 1.0 / (1.0 + math.exp(-temp_real))
```

## 🏥 Clinical Features

### 1. Probability Conversion
- **Fixed-point to Probability**: Converts hardware outputs to 0-1 range
- **Sigmoid Activation**: Smooth probability curves for medical confidence
- **Q8.8 Format**: 8 integer + 8 fractional bits for precision

### 2. Primary Diagnosis
- **Highest Probability**: Identifies the most likely condition
- **Confidence Scoring**: Percentage-based confidence levels
- **Clinical Validation**: Medical recommendations for each condition

### 3. Secondary Findings
- **Multi-label Support**: Detects multiple conditions simultaneously
- **Threshold-based**: Conditions with >30% probability flagged
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Complete medical picture

### 4. Urgency Assessment
- **HIGH URGENCY**: Pneumothorax (emergency care required)
- **MODERATE URGENCY**: Atelectasis, Mass, Pneumonia (24-48 hours)
- **LOW URGENCY**: No Finding (routine follow-up)
- **STANDARD URGENCY**: Other conditions (1-2 weeks)
